# Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury

## Introduction and Definition

~~A standardized definition is still lacking among involved organizations but the term mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) generally describes closed head injury with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 13-15.~~ Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause for morbidity and mortality in all age groups and is a major public health issue. The majority of these are classified as mild brain injury (mTBI), traditionally defined as closed head injury with an initial Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 13-15. ~~and only  brief loss of consciousness and amnesia.~~ Such injury initially may cause specific, mild clinical symptoms such as altered sensorium or brief loss of consciousness or amnesia {Tator:2014kw, Sundman:2015fk} but the significant long-tern consequences of such injury, especially when repetitive, remains a subject of great interest.  **Head concussion** is frequently used interchangeably with mTBI. ==While we will continue to use the term mTBI here,== Concussion is perhaps the more appropriate term because the word mild can be misleading when the significant, life-long consequences of repetitive concussions ~~as in post concussive syndrome (PCS) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)~~ are taken into account. Additionally, the mTBI by traditional definition may include more severe brain injuries such as brain contusions and haemorrhages in patients with a GCS of 13 and 14 {Tator:2014kw}, when it is now more frequently used to to imply diffuse axonal injury.						

mTBI is prevalent at all age groups and is also escalating in frequency and therefore has been referred to as the “silent epidemic”. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its report to the Congress estimated that TBIs, either as an isolated injury or in combination with other injuries, accounted for approximately 2.5 million emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States {ThomasRFrieden:2015tg}. The economic impact is substantial as well as mTBI accounts ==for about 44% of the $56 billion annual cost of TBI in the United States. Thurman DJ: The epidemiology and economics of head trauma, in Head Trauma: Basic, Preclinical, and Clinical Directions. Ed- ited by Miller L, Hayes R. New York, JohnWiley & Sons, 2001, pp 327–347== However, the full scale of this public health problem is probably still dramatically underestimated for multiple reasons. It is estimated that no medical advice is sought in about 25% of mild and moderate TBI incidents given the lack of overt signs of injury initially. Even when patients develop delayed symptoms, these symptoms are fairly nonspecific and therfore patients only rarely associate them with the injury ~~++{Sosin:1996dg, Nowinski:2013tk}++~~. In the recent few years, increasing evidence have suggested repetitive subconcussive hits to the head may result in negative outcome, even in patients who lack history of a clinically evident reference head injury {Dashnaw:2012cw}. ~~Such subconcussive injuries are even more likely to be underreported.~~

## Clinical Manifestations of Concussions

It is clear now that mTBI may result in any of a number of different clinical disorders. This concussion spectrum of disorders is wide and variable, ranging from acute concussion to various chronic brain degenerative disorders ~~with second impact syndrome or acute cerebral swelling and postconcussion syndrome in between~~ {Tator:2014kw}. 
Of the **acute concussion** symptoms, post-traumatic amnesia, state of confusion, sleep/asleep alterations, loss of consciousness, headache, and behavioral alterations and nausea are commonly reported symptoms. When symptoms persist for more than 3 months, the term **post-concussive syndrome (PCS)** is used and this is estimated to happen in 10-15% of reported ==??mild== head injuries [^Parizel1998] {Bigler:2008ix, Williams:2010da}. The **second impact syndrome (SIS)** is a rare entity and describes the exaggerated brain damage that results from a second concussion if sustained within the immediate period following the first injury, resulting in acute brain swelling and 50% reported mortality rate {Nowinski:2013tk}. This was explained by transient subcellular metabolic alterations that affect the brain following the initial concussion, which leave the brain in a metabolically vulnerable state {Longhi:2005ei}. There is an MR spectroscopic evidence for this transient metabolic alteration and vulnerability, which has been shown to extends up to 30 days post-injury {Vagnozzi:2010ewb}. 

In addition, ~~to producing persistent cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric problems,~~ repetitive concussive and subconcussive injuries can also lead to **chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)**, a progressive neurodegeneration characterized by widespread deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) {McKee:2013kr}. CTE encompasses specific neurorodegenerative disorders, many of which carry partial resemblance, both pathologically and clinically, to other well-described neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) {McKee:2013kr, McKee:2014wf}. The original description of CTE dates back to 1928 when Harrison Martland, a New Jersey pathologist, described a progressive neurological deterioration in boxers, which he attributed to repetitive brain trauma and called it ‘punch drunk’ {Martland:1928cv}. Subsequently, it became clear that this entity is not limited to boxers and therefore the term was changed to progressive traumatic encephalopathy and later to CTE {Critchley:1957vs, Critchley:1949wq} 

## Pathology

==The scale of the neuropathology associated with traumatic brain injury varies. While some of the pathology is macroscopic enough to be detected by conventional imaging, especially when hemorrhagic, a significant part of the pathology, especially early on happens at a microscopic or even biochemical subcellular level and therefore difficult to demonstrate in the clinical setting.==   

### Contusions

While the solid nature of the skull protects the brain against direct injury, it can also result in brain 'bruises' when there is friction between the two and are called contusions ~~and can be the direct or indirect result of the trauma~~. Unlike the direct brain injury caused by depressed skull fracture, contusions in the setting of mTBI are indirectly caused by the acceleration/deceleration forces that induce movement of the brain relative to the fixed skull. ==Histologically, contusions are...== These contusions tend to involve the cortex along the top of the gyri and are most prevalent along the inferior, lateral and anterior surfaces of the frontal and temporal lobes where the inner skull surface is most roughened. The falx and tentorium are also rigid enough to also cause brain contusions. Given the rich blood supply to cortex, these contusions are frequently **hemorrhagic** and the hemorrhage can extend either deeply into the white-matter or superficially into the subarachnoid and subdural spaces. The hemorrhage might be very subtle and difficult to detect by imaging. **Edema** develops over the subsequent hours and days, making the lesions more conspicuous on both CT and MRI. Chronically, these lesions can transform into **necrosis** with associated volume loss (encephalomalacia).

### Diffuse Axonal Injury

In addition to the superficially located contusions, the acceleration/deceleration forces in mTBI can also cause deep injuries by partially or completely shearing the fragile axons through inducing differential movement between tissues that differ in density or rigidity. This axonal injury is termed diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and though it varies in severity and manifestations, it is the most frequent explanation for coma and poor outcome associated with significant closed head injury from automobile accidents. Axonal ultrastructural analysis have shown that shearing leads to immediate mechanical disruption and buckling of the microtubules, which subsequently triggers progressive microtubule disassembly leading to failure of axonal transport {TangSchomer:2010ji, Blennow:2012}. Axonal transport failure results in **axonal swellings** within days and is most commonly located in the cortical sulci at the interface between gray and white matter. Over the following months, secondary disconnection and ultimately **wallerian degeneration** develop {Johnson:2013gfa, Blennow:2012}. ~~By imaging, evidence for axonal swelling (retraction ball) develops within days while walleriandegeneration takes place over months.~~ Given that DAI is largely a microscopic injury, the extent of the injury is significantly underestimate by both CT and conventional MRI (cMRI) ~~though to different extents~~. Multiple newer imaging techniques can better visualize this type of tissue damage.

### Endothelial Injury

Like axons, the endothelial cells in small vessels are susceptible to shearing and this contributes to concussion-induced neuropathology by leading to focal ischemia and blood-brain barrier disruption {Blennow:2012}.

*{Blennow:2012}*

### Accumulation and Hyperphosphorylation of Tau

In addition to immediate, mechanical disruption of the microtubules, it is well accepted that stretching of neuronal and axonal cell membranes and the accompanying endothelial injury can trigger a cascade of events resulting in neuronal failure. One of the first steps in this cascade is the influx of calcium into the injured cells, which activates calpain-mediated proteolytic degradation of neurofilament side arms and phosphorylation. **Hyperphosphorylation of tau**, one of the axonal proteins, plays a crucial role in the chronic manifestations of mTBI. Tau normally binds to microtubules promoting their assembly and stability but hyperphosphorylation reduces its microtubule binding, resulting in microtubule disassembly and ultimately leads to its aggregation into insoluble neurofibrillary tangels and neuropil threads {Mandelkow:2012cq, Blennow:2012}. In a postmortem analysis of 85 brains from subjects with histories of repetitive mTBI and CTE, 68 of the subjects (80%) showed pathologic evidence of hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposition. There was also strong correlation between the severity and extent of tau deposition and the severity of the symptoms {McKee:2013kr}, leading to a progressive staging of pathology from stage I with focal, perivascular deposition to stage V with more severe, widespread deposition. The aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau ~~into insoluble neurofibrillary tangels and neuropil threads~~ is the basis not only for CTE but also for other neurodegenerative disorders. Among the aforementioned 68 subjects with CTE and pathologic evidence of hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposition, 25 subjects (37%) also exhibited coexisting neurodegerative disorders, such as motor neuron disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This led the author to suggest that deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein may also promote the accumulation of other abnormally aggregated proteins including TAR DNA-binding protein 43, amyloid beta protein and alpha-synuclein {McKee:2013kr}. 

### Increased Brain Susceptibility to Repeated Trauma

There is very little disagreement regarding the accumulative negative effects of repeated, even subconcussive brain trauma but the cellular and molecular basis for the phenomenon are not as well understood. ~~and might be multifactorial.~~ Post concussive MR spectroscopic findings have shown that the metabolic dysfunction extends well beyond the initial injury and can persist up to 30 days post-injury. This probably opens a window of vulnerability when even a minor head injury can result in significant damage because of the preexisting increased metabolic demands and decreased energy stores {Vagnozzi:2010ewb}. ~~with a low ATP/DTP ratio and increased lactate/pyruvate ratio (Jenkins et al., 1989; Vespa et al., 2005; Vagnozzi et al., 2008)~~ Yuen et al by applying sequential identical injuries to a cell culture system has found that the initial injury upregulates expression of sodium channels (NaChs) by 24 hours so that the  second, identical injury resulted in exaggerated pathologic increases in intracellular calcium leading to axonal degeneration {Yuen:2009cj}. ~~Mild brain trauma was considered to stimulate the effect of sodium channelopathy on axons by intensifying the pathophysiological responses to succeeding minor injuries. ++Yuen et al. 2009++~~

## Imaging

Concussions or mTBI not only inherently suffer from problems with perception because of the subtle nature and clinical consequences initially, they also only rarely cause gross pathology such as hemorrhage or other structural abnormalities. Therefore, they are frequently invisible or significantly underestimated by conventional imaging tools {Sundman:2015fk, Gonzalez:2011cvb}. 

### Computed Tomography

In mTBI, structural brain abnormalities like cerebral contusions, edema, and epidural and subdural hematomas (SDH), and skull fractures are often lacking. It has been estimated that abnormalities on CT in mTBI are present in only 5% if GCS is 15, 20% with a GCS of 14 and 30% with a GCS of 13. ==Borg J, Holm L, Cassidy JD, et al: Diagnostic procedures in mild traumatic brain injury: results of the World Health Organiza- tion Collaborating Centre Task Force on mild traumatic brain injury. J Rehabil Med 2004; 43:S61–75== Therefore, the main role of computed tomography (CT) imaging in mTBI in the acute setting is to identify the clinically relevant intracranial lesions that may require neurosurgical intervention, hospitalization, and/or rigorous follow-up {Gonzalez:2011cvb}. CTs have been reported to be abnormal in fewer than 10% of cases of mTBI, and the number of injuries that require neurosurgical intervention is even smaller, estimated between 0.1% and 1% {DaceyJr:1986vp, Kuppermann:2008up}. Given the low yield of CT for mTBI imaging, several decision-making guidelines have been proposed. Such guidelines are even more important given the increasing awareness of radiation risk. The **New Orleans Criteria** were set based on a review by Haydel et al {Haydel:2000kq}. In phase one of the study, head CT scan were obtained in 520 consecutive patients with minor head injury, defined as normal GCS and normal findings on a brief neurologic examination. Positive CT scans were identified only in patients who had one or more of the following seven clinical findings: headache, vomiting, an age over 60 years, drug or alcohol intoxication, deficits in short-term memory, physical evidence of trauma above the clavicles, and seizure. In the second phase, the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria for predicting a positive CT scan were evaluated in a separate group of 909 consecutive patients with minor head injury. All 57 patients with positive CT scans had at least one of the seven findings, sensitivity was 100 percent. The authors estimated that using the criteria in phase 2 of their study would have reduced the number of CT scans by 22% {Haydel:2000kq}. The **Canadian CT Head Rule** for patients with minor head injury is another example. Minor head injury here was defined as witnessed loss of consciousness (LOC), definite amnesia, or witnessed disorientation in patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15 {Stiell:2001to}. In this study, the risk was stratified into 2 groups; high risk (for neurosurgical intervention) and medium risk (for identifiable brain injury on CT). ￼The high- and medium-risk factors are illustrated in ==(img)==. The researchers suggested that CT is indicated in patients who have any of the five high-risk factors. On the other hand, patients with one of the two medium-risk characteristics were not found to be at risk for needing neurological intervention though may still have clinically important CT lesions. The authors suggested either obtaining CT or close observation {Stiell:2001to}.

*{Stiell:2001to}*

Cerebral contusions and subdural hematomas (SDHs) are the most common mTBI CT findings {Haydel:2000kq, Borczuk:1995uu, Miller:1997uz}. **Contusions** are essentially brain bruises, resulting from disruption of small vessels with associated hemorrhage and edema in the cortex. These can be subtle initially, appearing as relatively small cortical/subcortical foci of hypoattenuation or hyperattenuation. Over hours to days, they mature with more prominent hemorrhage and edema. Ultimately, they leave areas of gliosis. These contusions can occur anywhere though they have tendency to occur along the inferior, anterior, and lateral surfaces of the frontal and temporal lobes, presumably from friction against the roughened inner table of the skull {Yousem:2010iu}. Hemorrhagic contusions can occasionally be associated with subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. **Subdural hemorrhage** is hemorrhage localized to the potential space between the pia-arachnoid and the dura and is the result of shearing of the bridging veins. These bridging veins are relatively fixed at the adjacent sinus or dura and cannot move to the same extent as the brain does, especially during a rotational movement. These veins are ensheathed with arachnoid trabecuale as they traverse the subarachnoid space but not in the subdural space and that is why the hemorrhage preferentially localizes to this space {Yousem:2010iu}. Because of underlying brain volume loss in the elderly, SDHs tend to not present until they are larger. Subdural hematomas may rarely develop in a delayed fashion following head injury, despite a negative initial CT scan. **Other CT findings** associated with mTBI include epidural hematomas as well as skull fractures. ~~++DO I NEED TO GO INTO THE DETAILS OF EACH ABNORMALITY; LIKE SDH, EDH, FRACTURES…++~~

### Conventional MRI (cMRI)

Unlike CT, cMRI is usually performed in the subacute and chronic settings when post concussive symptoms persist for weeks or months after the injury. MRI provides increased sensitivity for detecting structural abnormalities compared to CT scan but remains insensitive, even in symptomatic patients. Indeed, 43% to 68% of mild TBI patients show no abnormality by cMRI. ==Hofman PA, Stapert SZ, van Kroonenburgh MJ, et al: MR imaging, single-photon emission CT, and neurocognitive perfor- mance after mild traumatic brain injury. Am J Neuroradiol 2001; 22:441–449 Hughes DG, Jackson A, Mason DL, et al: Abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging seen acutely following mild trau- matic brain injury: correlation with neuropsychological tests and delayed recovery. Neuroradiology 2004; 46:550–558==

A conventional MRI study for head injury typically includes T1-weighted and T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and a heme-sensitive sequence such as T2\*-weighted gradient echo sequence/gradient recovery echo (GRE) or susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). SWI utilizes phase data in addition to magnitude data to accentuate the signal loss associated with susceptibility-induced dephasing and is even more sensitive compared to GRE sequences.

#### Contusions

In a relatively small sample of 21 consecutive mTBI patients, Hofman et al. showed MRI abnormalities acutely in 12 patients (57%), mainly on FLAIR and T2\*-weighted imaging. The **acute** traumatic abnormalities detected were cortical contusions as areas of edema which appeared hyperitense. Such lesions were larger and more numerous on FLAIR compared to T2\*. When these lesions were hemorrhagic, deoxyhemoglobin was most conspicuous on T2\*. The contusions were predominantly frontal and temporal in distribution. Occasionally, punctuate hemorrhages were detected only on T2\* in the white-matter reflecting DAI. ~~Other acute MRI abnormalities in this study included extra axial hemorrhages.~~ Follow-up MRI **at 6 months** did not show new lesions but showed more atrophy reflecting posttraumatic encephalomalacia and reactive gliosis in all patients with MRI abnormalities on the initial scan {Hofman:2001gz}. ~~Interestingly, there was not a significant difference at neurocognitive testing conducted at 2 and 6 months after injury between patients with normal and abnormal MRI findings and only one patient in this study met the criteria for PCS~~ 

#### DAI

While contusions are better detected by MRI, they are still frequently visible on CT. On the other hand, DAI is a much more subtle lesion and only rarely seen by CT~~, especially when in the posterior fossa and deep white matter~~. DAI represents a deeper shear injury along the white-matter tracts. DAI tend to involve specific white-matter areas that are subject to the maximum shear strain. These areas include the **gray-white junction**, corpus callosum, brain stem, superior cerebellar peduncle and internal capsule. (img)  

 ![screenshot](../../../../../var/folders/w8/0906fgp93t1gh4126yg2n3qc0000gn/T/com.evernote.Evernote/WebKitDnD.NolEXU/screenshot.png)

*{Yousem:2010iu}*

In mTBI, as opposed to moderate an severe TBI, DAI lesions tend to be fewer in number and subcortical in distribution, as opposed to the larger number of lesions and more central distribution involving the brainstem and corpus callosum in the more severe TBIs. ~~++The following lesions are more for moderate/severe TBI.++ For the **corpus callosal** lesions, the splenium is the most frequent site involved and this is thought to be related to the falx being broader and more stiff posteriorly and subsequently restricting the movement of the cerebrum across midline. Corpus callosal body involvement is also common and tend to be inferior and lateralized to one side. Similarly, in the **brain stem** lesions, involvement tends to be adjacent to the superior cerebellar peduncle in the dorsolateral quadrant of the rostral brain stem.~~ Just like contusions, DAI lesions can be nonhemorrhagic or hemorrhagic and their MRI appearance differ accordingly. The hemorrhage originates from the DAI-associated capillary injury and therefore a specific but not necessarily sensitive indirect sign of DAI. Hemorrhage is best detected by the heme-sensitive sequence. In a study of 20 consecutive patient with mTBI and normal head CT scans, Mitti et al have shown MRI evidence of DAI in 6 patient (30%) defined as white-matter abnormality on either T2 or T2\* imaging {Mittl:1994tv}. ==SWI is even more sensitive.== Chronically, MRI can show posttraumatic encephalomalacia, reactive gliosis, and hemosiderin deposits.

### Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)

While it is estimated that cMRI can show evidence of hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic DAI in an additional 30% of CT negative mTBI patients [^Mittl:1994tv], 





> Mittl et al. showed in their study that conventional MR imaging played a major role in any classification scheme in injury, especially in mildly head-injured patients. Their results revealed conventional spin-echo MR imaging changes compa- tible with non-hemorrhagic and hemorrhagic DAI after MTBI, which were not shown by CT in y30% of cases19. However, our data showed that conventional MR sequences underestimated the extent of DAI. Several authors also reported that conventional imaging techniques have generally proved insensitive to detec- tion of abnormalities associated with MTBI in patients with persistent cognitive deficits11,20,21. On the other hand, conventional MR sequences are necessary because of their ability to depict areas of gliosis or tissue necrosis, which are often associated with brain trauma, and to provide detailed anatomic information about brain lesions11.show about 30% ++HERE++

~~Susceptibility-weighted images have proven even more sensitive for detecting the hemorrhage sometimes associated with the contusions and DAI.~~

> These regions include the body (usually lateralized to one side and on the inferior surface) and the splenium (most common location) of the corpus callosum. The unbending falx, which is broader posteriorly, prevents the cerebral hemispheres from moving across the midline, whereas anteriorly the falx is shorter so that the brain can transiently move across the midline. The fibers of the splenium and posterior corpus callosum are thus under greater risk of shearing than the anterior fibers. If the lesion is midline, you may note disruption of the septum pellucidum and ventricular blood secondary to disruption of subependymal veins and capillaries. Lesions are also seen in the dorsolateral quadrant of the rostral part of the brain stem, adjacent to the superior cerebellar peduncle. Brain stem DAI tends to be associated with more profound injury. It may be inconspicuous on initial CT. Diffuse damage to other axons, including those in the internal capsule and subcortical white matter, may also be present. The most severe DAI results in lesions in all of these locations. The mildest form tends to have lesions at the gray-white junctions of the frontal and temporal lobes. In 11% of patients with DAI, associated intracranial hematoma can be identified. Pathologic findings depend on length of survival. Within days axonal swelling (retraction ball) develops, within weeks microglial clusters are observed, and within months wallerian degeneration takes place. Rotationally induced shear-strain may also produce cortical contusion and lesions in the deep gray matter. 



 areas of maximum stress white matter The latter usually ese focal hemorrhagic foci which appear as foci of extreme low signal (black) because of susceptibility effect. These persist into the chronic phase reflecting the presence of hemosiderin, a blood degradation product. Other chronic MRI findings include posttraumatic encephalomalacia and reactive gliosis. 



, it is still not an ideal imaging tool for mTBI given that such structural abnormalities are often lacking. Acute hemorrhagic contusions appear T2-hypointense due to the presence of deoxyhemoglobin and are surrounded by high-intensity edema. T2-weighted gradient echo and susceptibility-weighted images are even more sensitive for detecting these focal hemorrhagic foci which appear as foci of extreme low signal (black) because of susceptibility effect. These persist into the chronic phase reflecting the presence of hemosiderin, a blood degradation product. 

> Furthermore, FLAIR sequences have been found to be more sensitive than T2-weighted images in the detection of hemorrhagic lesions [12]. In one prospective study, MRI abnormalities, more commonly seen on FLAIR sequences, were seen acutely in 57% of patients with mTBI [12]. On follow-up at 6 months, all the patients with an abnormal baseline MRI demonstrated brain atrophy with repeated imaging. 

Subdural and epidural hemorrhage appear just like 

 still does not lend it self for imaging 

### DTI

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) utilizes the diffusion characteristic of water molecules to image the brain, which yields an insight to the microstructural that affect the brain following trauma.   . 

> Although, conventional MR and CT scans are unable to detect the microscopic damage occurring with DAI, new neuroimaging techniques are emerging that may yield key insight to microstructural changes in the brain following TBI. {Sundman:2015fk}



# Outcome

> Cognitive deficits resulting from TBI (post concussion syndrome) include decreased speed in information processing; poor attention, concentration, and memory; and impaired logical reasoning skill, as well as more focal deficits, including impairment of language or constructional abilities. The correlation of head injury symptoms and their sequelae is controversial, yet there is growing evidence that head injury even mild in nature may have greater consequences than previously assumed. Indeed, TBI is now considered a risk factor in the development of Alzheimer disease and is reported in NFL players. 
> There are many reports describing loss of brain parenchymal volume as the sequelae of TBI in particular structures, including the caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, fornix, and thalamus. These injuries result in enlargement of the ventricles (width of the third ventricle, bicaudate span of the lateral ventricles, area of lateral ventricles, total ventricular volume, temporal horn, or ventricular/brain ratio). Posttraumatic thalamic atrophy has been correlated with the presence of cortical and subcortical (but nonthalamic) lesions. This suggests that such traumatic lesions may be responsible for transneuronal degeneration. Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (see Chapter 8) may result from traumatic injuries affecting the red nucleus, dentate nucleus, central tegmental tract, or cerebellar peduncles. Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tract will often be seen after contusions/shears of the motor area of the frontal cortex or white matter tracts, respectively. 
> The increased prevalence of cavum septum pellucidum has been observed to be increased in professional boxers and soccer players. This has been related to repetitive head trauma with tearing of the septal walls and secondary CSF dissection of the septi forming a cavum.
